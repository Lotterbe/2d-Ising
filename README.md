# 2d-Ising


In this Github repository one can find a programm for simulating data for the 2d Ising Modell with the Metropolis algorithm. The Metropolis algorithm will be find in the Metropolis class in Metropolis.py. For measuring the observables, theoretical values and variances (with bootstrap) in Metropolis.py one find the Observables class. For animating and visualizing the simulated data there is the Ising_Ani class in Ising_Visualizing.py. For detailed information look into PP_IsingModell2D_Debus_Weitz.pdf. There one can find more information about the project.
